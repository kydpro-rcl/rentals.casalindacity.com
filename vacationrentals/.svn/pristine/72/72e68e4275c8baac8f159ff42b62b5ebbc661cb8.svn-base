<br />
<br />
How do I book a home?</strong><br />
Booking a villa is easy!&nbsp; You can either book directly on this website by using the &quot;check availability box&quot; to the left, or you can call our office at +1.809.571.1190,&nbsp;and one of our friendly booking agents will happy to assist you.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Is booking online secure?</strong><br />
Yes!&nbsp; We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway provider&rsquo;s database. It will only be accessible by those authorized with special rights to such systems. They are legally required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<strong>What are the benefits of renting a whole vacation villa as opposed to staying in a resort?</strong><br />
Privacy.&nbsp; You have your own pool, and your own space which includes a secluded yard, well stocked kitchen, BBQ, comfortable bedrooms, private baths and great onsite services.&nbsp; We believe our villas are homes away from home &ndash; there are no cramped hotel spaces here.&nbsp;<br />
No line ups, no waiting for services or amenities.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never line up for a meal at Casa Linda &ndash; just walk up to our restaurant or order a chef to come cook for you!&nbsp; Your lounge chair is just yours to use for the duration of your stay with us.&nbsp; We also offer lower priced excursions and priority service.<br />
<br />
