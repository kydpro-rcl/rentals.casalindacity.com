<strong>ABOUT CASA LINDA:</strong><br />
Casa Linda&rsquo;s villa community is special; a tropical oasis set amongst the incredible beauty of the North Coast of the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; We began over 20-years ago and have slowly built to encompass over 250 villas.&nbsp; Each villa in Casa Linda is privately owned.&nbsp; We are an international community.<br />
Many owners live in Casa Linda full time, but others only visit us as their time permits.&nbsp; They have chosen to place their homes in our rental program and earn income when they are not using it personally.&nbsp; Each owner and their villa is unique, as is each renter that visits Casa Linda.&nbsp; It is our privilege to welcome you to our rental homes. We hope you love it here as much as we do.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our rental program is owned and managed by DR company RCL&nbsp;Administraciones, SRL.&nbsp;<br />
